            <h2>Meet Dr. Hwang</h2><br>
            <p>
                Dr. Hwang is a highly accomplished dentist with <b>over 15 years of experience</b>, bringing a
                unique blend of expertise from both Korea and the United States. He is one of the rare
                dental professionals to have successfully completed specialty training in both countries,
                offering an unparalleled depth of knowledge and skill.<br><br>
                In Korea, he completed his residency in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at <b>Korea University
                    Hospital</b>and earned a <b>Ph.D. from Korea University College of Medicine</b>. He served as a
                specialist in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, held a director position at the <b>Korean Academy
                    of Implant Dentistry (KAID)</b>, and earned certification in Maxillofacial Plastic and
                Reconstructive Surgery in Korea. Dr. Hwang is particularly known for his exceptional skills
                in <b>complex implant surgery and wisdom tooth extractions</b>.<br><br>
                After relocating to the U.S., Dr. Hwang completed the <b>Advanced Education in General
                    Dentistry (AEGD) </b>program at the University of Connecticut (UCONN). He then worked as a
                general dentist at various practices, including Midwest Dental in Wisconsin and Smile Dental
                and Top Dental in Virginia, treating a wide range of patients and dental needs. His cross-
                continental background makes him uniquely capable of delivering truly comprehensive
                care—seamlessly combining advanced surgical expertise with general dentistry.<br><br>
                Dr. Hwang was inspired to open OneDay Dental after witnessing the inconvenience and time
                burden patients often face when visiting multiple dental offices for specialized procedures.
                Motivated by empathy and a deep understanding of patient needs, he envisioned a single
                clinic where patients could receive complete dental treatment—efficiently and effectively.<br><br>
                Dr. Hwang's <b>unwavering commitment to patient care </b>means he strives to ensure that
                every patient leaves his office with a confident, satisfied smile. His compassionate, patient-
                centered approach, combined with his advanced clinical expertise, has earned him the
                lasting trust of those he treats.</p>
